I needed a fun project for my Python programming course and decided to make a
Card Against Humanity program. Hopfully I can make an online version out of it,
But for now it's just a command line thingy.

I did not make Cards Against Humanity. This was done by the good guys of:
(English) https://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com/
(Dutch)   https://www.cards-against-humanity.nl/

I got the text from the question and answer cards from:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samurailink3/hangouts-against-humanity/master/source/data/cards.js
and
https://github.com/nodanaonlyzuul/against-humanity
